He was devastated and in disbelief. Roger Federer had just shattered his dreams in the 2009 Wimbledon final. But in the midst of his torment, sitting distraught in the locker room, Andy Roddick was struck by Federer's act of kindness in the aftermath of victory.Ten years later, the Swiss legend is still going strong and second favorite to clinch a record-extending ninth title at the All England Club when the tournament begins next week.The 37-year-old Federer may well be the best men's player of all time with a record 20 grand slam victories (and 10 runner-up spots), but his aura and popularity add up to far more than the sum of his titles.Perhaps it has to do with his longevity and elegant playing style. But according to Roddick, that moment behind closed doors, shortly after going down 16-14 in the fifth set of an epic final, speaks volumes for the man himself."It's not like separate locker rooms or anything else, so I walked in and I was pretty devastated," Roddick told CNN Sport. "I was in disbelief and shock and a lot of emotions, and his team comes in."They should have been celebrating. Absolutely. I saw him out of the corner of my eye, he kind of gave them one of these 'Be quiet' (signs) and point to me and they walked out and went about their business in another part of the All England Club."I thought that was considerate. I thought it was probably unnecessary given that's a whole life of work. But it was kind of a microcosm of maybe the way he thinks a little bit."
