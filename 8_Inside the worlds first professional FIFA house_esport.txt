At first glance, nothing seems out of the ordinary about this suburban house.White curtains drape the windows, pizza boxes spill out from the recycling bin and weeds creep between the gaps in the garden path.But take a closer look and you'll discover something unique in this North London house -- it's home to a professional FIFA team.AS Roma Fnatic has been ensconced at this address for the last six months, its inhabitants living, breathing, practicing and competing as they play the most popular virtual football game on the market FIFA.As the name suggests, the team represents Italy's Serie A team AS Roma, but is in fact largely driven by esports powerhouse Fnatic.In 2018, the lucrative partnership decided to take the next step in professionalizing its approach, by creating the world's first FIFA house."When you walk up to the front of the house, it doesn't look like a team of gamers live here," team manager Colin Johnson told CNN Sport, who is honest enough to admit that very occasionally the team has disturbed suburbia's tranquility."We've had a few neighbors yelling at us a few times for being loud when we're celebrating but for the most part we're pretty nondescript when it comes to our activities and stuff around here."
