The Trial of Christine Keeler, which began on Sunday night, has divided the opinion of critics and viewers alike.The show tells the infamous 1960s "sex scandal" story of the affair between government war minister John Profumo and the 19-year-old Christine Keeler.With two sex scenes in the first few minutes, the Mail called it a "soft porn version of The Crown".The Independent described it as "a timely, scandalous story about sleazy politicians".The six-part series stars Sophie Cookson as Keeler and Ben Miles as Profumo, while James Norton is Stephen Ward, an osteopath and artist who instigated the pair's meeting.Where previous versions focused on the men in the story, this new BBC version is told from Keeler's point of view.Sex was at the heart of the story and what ultimately led it to contribute towards the downfall of Harold Macmillan's government.Writing in the Mail, Christopher Stevens began his five-star review saying: "Auntie, really! The nation's staid and stately broadcaster has revealed herself to be as secretly kinky as a High Court judge in silk suspenders!
