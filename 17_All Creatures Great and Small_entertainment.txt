The original BBC adaptation (pictured) was a huge hit in the 1970s and 1980s. The stories followed the lives of a group of vets in a Yorkshire village. Now the much-loved books are being filmed again, this time for Channel 5. The series is being made to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the publication of the first of the books, If Only They Could Talk.
