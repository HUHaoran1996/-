Juventus and Portugal fans, don't worry, Cristiano Ronaldo doesn't plan on retiring anytime soon.But when his football career does come to an end, the 34-year-old says he'd like to go into acting.He wouldn't be the first footballer to make that move, with Eric Cantona and Vinnie Jones going from the pitch to the big screen after hanging up their boots."I hope I live more than 50 years to learn new things and face different challenges and try to find solutions for them," Ronaldo was quoted as saying by Goal at the Dubai Sports Conference. "One of the things that I seek to challenge myself in, for example, is acting in a movie."I always recommend learning all that is new. This is what I always strive for. I always seek to educate myself, because my studies tend to answer many of the questions on my mind."It could be a while before the former Real Madrid, Manchester United and Sporting Lisbon forward changes profession, though.
