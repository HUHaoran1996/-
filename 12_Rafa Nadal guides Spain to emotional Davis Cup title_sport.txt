Rafael Nadal capped a remarkable season, guiding Spain to a sixth Davis Cup title as he beat Denis Shapovalov to seal victory over Canada in Madrid's Caja Magica.Earlier on Sunday, Roberto Bautista Agut edged past Felix Auger-Aliassime 7-6 (7-3), 6-3, ensuring Nadal's 6-3, 7-6 (9-7) win over Shapovalov gave Spain an unassailable 2-0 lead in the revamped tournament.In 2010 Nadal won three majors, but the 33-year-old will likely look back on 2019 as an extraordinary year as he won the French Open and the US Open, made the Australian Open final and also reached the Wimbledon semifinals.The Mallorcan also finishes the season as world No. 1. Oh and he married longtime partner Xisca Perello last month.
